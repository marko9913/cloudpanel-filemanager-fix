# 🔧 Fix for CloudPanel File Manager Issue (2025-10-07)

## 🐞 Problem  
CloudPanel's built-in File Manager may fail to open or edit files due to a broken external CDN link for loading CodeMirror components (e.g. `matchbrackets.js`).

This issue causes files to endlessly load when trying to open or edit them inside the File Manager interface.

## ✅ Solution  
Replace the default `filemanager.js` with the fixed version available in this repository.

### 📂 File Path (Typical Installation)
```
/home/clp/htdocs/app/files/public/file-manager/assets/filemanager.js
```

### 🛠 How to Apply

1. **Replace** the existing `filemanager.js` with the one from this repository.
2. **Restart Nginx** to apply changes:
   ```bash
   systemctl restart nginx
   ```
3. **Refresh CloudPanel** in your browser:
   - On Windows: Press `Ctrl + F5`
   - Or open CloudPanel in a different browser to bypass cache.

> This fix forces CloudPanel to use a working and reliable CDN (cdnjs) instead of the broken one (speedcdnjs), ensuring CodeMirror features load correctly again.
